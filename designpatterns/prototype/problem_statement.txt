Problem statement: Create a data base connection and use the same for each service. Any changes for the connection of serviceA should not effect the connection serviceB

Brute-Force1: 
1. everytime make network call for the data base connection for each service

Optimised-approadh:
1. only one time, make the call, now write a function over that connection that will create a deep copy and return. -> This is the prototype pattern

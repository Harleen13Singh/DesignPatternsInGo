Problem statement:
Chain of responsibility is used when we a request and there are multiple handlers for the same request.

The request can be handled by a single handler or multiple also.

The concrete handler can also update the request, or do something so that the next handler can easily process the same

also, a concrete handler, on run time decide to which next handler it has to send the request.

Let's try to build the decision engine using the CoR pattern.

Problem statement: we have an user id with us, and the user has applied for a credit card. we have multiple vendors for the credit card. we have to check which is the best vendor for the user.

each vendor has its own rules.

vendor_sir_bank: 1. User age > 23
                 2. User income > 10000k
                 3. No rule if User has some special 
                 characterstics
                 4. Bank api is up

vendor_hdfc: 1. User age > 20
             2. User income > 10000k
             3. Bank api is up

vendor_swiss_bank: 1. User age > 30
                   2. Use income > 2222k
                   3. Bank api is up


Let's create a similar problem statement as the decision engine and solve it using both CoR and Rule engine pattern

Problem statement: 

You have to build a sports shop simulator which sells bat and gloves for different types of sports.
Client will ask for the products for the given sport and all the logic for the products creation should be abstracted from the client.
For eg. If client asks for the Cricket products, factory should return cricket bat and cricket gloves only.

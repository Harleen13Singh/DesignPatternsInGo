Problem statement: 

You have to build a sports shop simulator which sells the sports products.
For simplicity, sports products includes a bat and a pair of gloves 

Client will ask for the products for the given sport and all the logic for the products creation should be abstracted from the client.

For eg. If client asks for the Cricket sports product, factory should return cricket bat and cricket gloves only.
